#  Pixel Pyro

**Pixel Pyro** is a robust, production-ready interactive fireworks simulator built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and the **HTML5 Canvas API**. It combines nostalgic 8-bit pixel art aesthetics with a physics-based particle engine and procedural audio synthesis.

##  Key Features

###  Diverse Arsenal of Fireworks
The game features over **20 unique types** of fireworks categorized into three distinct classes:

*   **Aerial:** High-flying rockets that paint the sky.
    *   *Includes:* The winding **Dragon**, the geometric **Flower Shot** (Rose curve pattern), the **Cyclone**, and the massive **50kg Skyshot**.
*   **Ground:** Stationary fountains and spinners.
    *   *Includes:* **Anar** (Fountain), **Chakri** (Spinning wheel), and **Flower Pots**.
*   **Bombs:** Loud, heavy-impact explosives.
    *   *Includes:* **Sutli Bomb**, **Garland** (Ladi), and **C4**.

###  Interactive NPCs & AI
The world feels alive with autonomous characters:
*   **The Boy:** An AI character with a state machine behavior. He walks, watches fireworks, **cowers** at loud explosions, **celebrates**, and occasionally lights his own sparklers or fireworks.
*   **The Angry Neighbors:** If you explode too many loud bombs near the house, the parents will appear at the door—**shaking with anger** and shouting via emoticon speech bubbles!

###  Interactive Environment
*   **Day/Night Cycle:** (Visualized via atmospheric glow).
*   **The Moon:** A dynamic celestial body. Hitting it with rockets causes it to chime. **Hit it 3 times to trigger a massive finale!**
*   **Physics:** Custom gravity, friction, wind resistance, and light trails for every particle.

###  Procedural Audio Engine
Zero external audio files are used. All sounds (explosions, whistles, crackles, thuds) are synthesized in real-time using the **Web Audio API**.
*   *Pink/White Noise generation for explosions.*
*   *Oscillators for whistles and sirens.*
*   *Dynamic filtering for distance and muffling.*
